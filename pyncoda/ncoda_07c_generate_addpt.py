# Address Point Inventory Workflow

## Overview
Functions to obtain and clean data required for the Address Point Inventory - 
which is a key component of the Housing Unit Allocation process. 
The address point inventory predicts the number of housing units in each structure in a building inventory. 


### Resources and references:
For an overview of the address point inventory and housing unit allocation method see:

Rosenheim, N., Guidotti, R., Gardoni, P., & Peacock, W. G. (2021). Integration of detailed household and housing unit characteristic data with critical infrastructure for post-hazard resilience modeling. Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure, 6(6), 385-401.

## Required Inputs
Program requires the following inputs:
1. program obtains and cleans US Census Block Data
2. program requires a geocoded building inventory
    - Future version of ICD will provide tools for generating a building inventory file
    - Current version will require users to have an IN-CORE account
3. Housing Unit Inventory - for expected address point counts by block
4. program will use the block data, expected counts, and building inventory to generate an address point inventory.
    
## Output Description
The output of this workflow is a CSV file with the address point inventory and a codebook that describes the data.

The output CSV is designed to be used in the Interdependent Networked Community Resilience Modeling Environment (IN-CORE) for the housing unit allocation model.

IN-CORE is an open source python package that can be used to model the resilience of a community. To download IN-CORE, see:

https://incore.ncsa.illinois.edu/


## Instructions
Users can run the workflow by executing each block of code in the notebook.
